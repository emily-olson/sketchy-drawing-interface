# Sketchy Drawing App – Object-Oriented Programming Project

This project was completed for *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming* at Brown University. The assignment involved building a fully functional GUI-based drawing application in Java, modeled after simple tools like MS Paint, with the ability to draw, move, delete, and animate shapes — all backed by a custom command stack for undo/redo functionality.

Sketchy was my first large-scale object-oriented project in Java, and it gave me experience with event-driven programming, JavaFX GUI components, and model-view-controller design.

## App Features

- **Drawing Tools**: Users can draw ovals and rectangles directly on a canvas.
- **Object Manipulation**: Shapes can be selected, moved, and deleted.
- **Undo/Redo Stack**: Implements command pattern to allow full undo/redo support.
- **Animations**: Shapes can be recorded in animation sequences that play on loop.
- **State Persistence**: Users can save their drawing state to disk and reload it later.

## Technologies

- Java
- JavaFX (GUI framework)
- Object-oriented design patterns (model-view-controller, Command Pattern)
- Custom serialization for save/load functionality
